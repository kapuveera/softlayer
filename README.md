# Utility Scripts
This is a repository for simple utility "helper" scripts for SoftLayer. At </br>
present the only entry is a wrapper program around the SoftLayer CLI to </br>
help users create virtual machines easily and safely on IBM SoftLayer. </br>
</br>
It is expected that this repository will grow over time to include many more </br>
helpful little shell script programs.
